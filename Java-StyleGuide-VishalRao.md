# StyleGuide
The "Vishal" style of code.


--------------------
## Rules

### Whitespace

Adopted directly from Google's Java Style Guide:

https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html#s2.3.1-whitespace-characters

### Indentation

#### Indentation Style


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style

#### Indentation Size

4 Spaces


#### Indentation Composition

No Tabs..only spaces.

It is recommended that you configure your editor/IDE to soft-tab your tab character into 4 spaces.
You can verify this is working when you tab and then left-arrow.  If you configured this correctly, you should need to left-arrow 4 times until you've reached the starting position of the tab.



### Spacing

Space between all tokens except for sides of parentheses.



### Imports

No wildcard imports.
