I'm thinking of coming up with some standard Code Review abbreviations, a 3-letter-max prefix we can all use.   For starters:```
NIT - nit-pick
CSV - coding standard violation
WSI - whitespace or indent is messed up
ECN - explanation comment needed
DOC - javadoc or header doc needed
SUG - suggestion, not required for approval
ALT - alternative way you could have coded this, just sayin'
BUG - the way it's coded has a glaring bug
